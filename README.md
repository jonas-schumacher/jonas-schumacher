Hi, I'm Jonas and I currently work as a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer** in a German energy company.

I'm interested in all sorts of Machine Learning with a particular focus on **Deep Reinforcement Learning**. In my professional roles I've worked mostly on Timeseries Forecasting and Computer Vision.
